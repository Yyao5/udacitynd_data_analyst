# Investigatng the Stroop effect

In this project, I invesitigated a phenonmenon called the Stroop effect. I analyzed and compared the time people reacted to report colors of print when the text and the color were congruent and incongruent respectively. The project covered descriptive statistical analysis and inferential statistics with hypothesis testing. 
### Finding
Based on the dataset, I found that the average time that people take to react to report colors of incongruent print is significantly longer than to report colors of congruent print with a 95% CI.
